# About Pandas Vet

**Pandas Vet** is a Python library for data science and data engineering. It adds non-invasive health checks for Pandas method chains.

The veterinarian can inspect and validate your data at various points in your Pandas pipelines, without modifying the underlying data.

So you don't need to chop up a functional method chain, or create intermediate variables, every time you need to diagnose, treat, or prevent problems with data processing.

As Fleetwood Mac says, [you would never break the chain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwTPvcPYaOo).
